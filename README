Invocation: ./oss [-h] [-i x]
=======================================================================================================================
How to Run:
                1. Type make
                2. Run the executable by typing ./oss [-h] [-i x]
                3. ./oss alone will run with the following default ./oss -i log
                4. Default files names (File holding run logs ("log"))
                5. -h   = describe how the project should be run and then terminate
                   -i   = specify the output file that information will be written to (default is "log")
                6. Type make clean to remove (log, oss.o and user.o) + executables (oss and user)
=======================================================================================================================
Files included:
                1. oss.c = Main driver file used for most operations
                2. user.c = Child processes file that oss communicates with via message queues and shared memory
                3. queue.h = Contains functions necessary for the queue operations
                4. shared.h = Contains the structs and information for shared memory
=======================================================================================================================
Version Control: (logging technique used)
                1. My log files are included in /classes/OS/drichard/drichard.4/log.txt
=======================================================================================================================
Comments on submission: All project requirments met I believe
                1. Running statistics are printed to the screen
                   - Average wait time, average blocked time, CPU idle time, and average CPU utilization
                2. Program will always terminate normally but stop writing to the file if it gets above 10,000 lines
                3. In the user processes file, I saw the comments given on March 31st as to give the process 4 options,
                   Terminate, get blocked, use all of time quantum, or get preempted. I did this using a random number
                   generator is user.c
                4. Queue 0 has the highest priority and contains real-time processes and queue1-queue2-queue3 go down
                   from there. And there is also one blocked queue
                5. If the process does not terminate, it will get blocked for r.s seconds which are random numbers
                   0-3 and 0-1000 then will become preemented after using p% of its time quantum where p is a random
                   number 0-100. If these three things do not happen, the process will use all of its assigned quantum
=======================================================================================================================
Aging Algorithm:
		1. This part was very confusing to me. I implemented this aging as a function is oss.c. What I did is
		   find the difference between the time spent on the cpu and wait time. After reviewing the average
		   numbers, I decided that if this number was above 1900000000 nanoseconds then I would manually
		   advance it in the queue that it is in, in turn raising the priority on that process so that it can
		   be handled before starving. Although if it is in queue 0 I do nothing because those processes will
		   be handled first anyways.
