=======================================================================================================================
Invocation: ./oss [-h] [-i x]
=======================================================================================================================
How to Run:
                1. Type make
                2. Run the executable by typing ./oss [-h] [-i x]
                3. ./oss alone will run with the following default ./oss -i log
		4. Default files names (File holding run logs ("log"))
                5. -h   = describe how the project should be run and then terminate
		   -i   = specify the output file that information will be written to (default is "log")
                6. Type make clean to remove (log, oss.o and user.o) + executables (oss and user)
=======================================================================================================================
Files included: 
		1. oss.c = Main driver file used for most operations
		2. user.c = Child processes file that oss communicates with via message queues and shared memory
		3. queue.h = Contains functions necessary for the queue operations
		4. shared.h = Contains the structs and information for shared memory
=======================================================================================================================
Version Control: (logging technique used)
                1. My log files are included in /classes/OS/drichard/drichard.4/log.txt
=======================================================================================================================
Comments on submission: All project requirments met
		1. Running statistics are printed to the screen
		   - Average wait time, average blocked time, CPU idle time, and average CPU utilization
		2. Program will always terminate normally but stop writing to the file if it gets above 10,000 lines
